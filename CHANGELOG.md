### Added
- **Delete Friend Feature**: Implemented a complete "Delete Friend" workflow from API to UI, allowing users to remove friends from their active list while preserving existing transaction history.
- **Improved Friend Search**: Added support for searching transactions by Friend ID in addition to Name, ensuring consistent filtering even after renames.

### Fixed
- **History UI Redundancy**: Fixed the issue where "我 付款" (Me paid) was displayed in transaction details when the payer was the current user. The label is now hidden for self-payments for a cleaner look.
- **Identity Logic Alignment**: Standardized UID-to-"我" resolution across `OverviewPage`, `FriendDetailPage`, and `app.js` to ensure the core accounting engine matches the local user identity.
- **Settings Page Layout Restoration**: Reverted the "Account" management section to the **bottom** of the page (after Projects and Friends) to maintain design consistency and original UX flow.
- **App Mode State Fix**: Fixed a critical bug in `app.js` where the `appMode` reactive state was not correctly exposed to the Vue template, which previously caused account management buttons to be hidden.

### Removed
- **Invitation System**: Completely removed the "Invite Friend" feature (both UI buttons and backend listeners/methods) to streamline the main application for stability.

*優化好友功能與介面：實作「刪除好友」功能；修正明細顯示冗餘；將帳號區塊恢復至設定頁面底部以維持設計一致性；及修復 `appMode` 狀態回傳錯誤以找回遺失的功能按鍵。*

 - 2026-02-06 Update (Guest & View Mode Refinement)

## 🌟 Guest Mode (體驗模式) Refinements
- **Data Logic Overhaul**:
  - **Separation of Local vs. Remote**: User-created data (Local) is now strictly separated from Demo data (Remote). Clearing or toggling "Import Data" will **not** delete your local entries.
  - **Always-On Metadata**: Even if "Import Data" is OFF, the app now fetches Categories, Payment Methods, and Config from the backend to ensure a seamless experience (menus won't be empty).
  - **Toggling Logic**: The "Import Data" toggle now only controls the visibility of Demo transactions.
- **Sorting Fix**: Fixed an issue where local transactions were forced to the bottom of the list. Now, all transactions (Local & Remote) are correctly sorted mixed by date (Newest First).
- **Payment Method Fix**: Resolved an issue where "Cash" and "PayPay" would appear as duplicates in the dropdown menu. Now strictly relies on backend configuration.

## 🚀 View Mode (Viewer) Polish
- **Dedicated Read-Only Page**:
  - Replaced the shared Edit Page with a new `ViewEditPage`.
  - **Removed**: "Start Editing" button, "Delete" button, and all input fields.

- **Settings Page Clean-up**: Removed the intrusive "Read Only" badge from the settings card for a cleaner aesthetic.
- **Search & Filter**:
  - The "Clear Filter" (CLEAR) button is now **always visible** in History Mode, allowing users to easily reset views without guessing if a filter is active.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes & Technical
- **Date Normalization**: Standardized remote date formats to ensure consistent grouping in the History list.

## [2026-02-09T00:46:00Z] Fixed FX Rate Loading in Viewer Mode

### Bug Fixes
- **Corrected Configuration Structure**: Fixed a bug where the `Viewer Mode` (Shared Links) was receiving an incorrect data structure for user settings. This caused the exchange rate (FX Rate) to default to 0.22 instead of using the sharer's personalized settings.
- **Improved Data Consistency**: Standardized the data format returned by the shared data fetcher to match the regular admin/guest modes.

### Technical Details
- Modified `_fetchDataForUser` in `js/api.js` to correctly return the `config` sub-object from the user document instead of the entire document.
- Ensured `user_name` override from the shared link configuration is correctly merged into the final `config` object.

## [2026-02-09T15:06:00Z] Chart Stability Restoration & Toggle Color Fix

### Bug Fixes
- **Stats Page Chart Colors**: Restored the original remote chart color palette to ensure the highest amount category uses the brand color `#4A4A4A`. The previous implementation incorrectly started with `#424242`, causing visual inconsistency.
  - 統計頁面圖表顏色修正：恢復遠端原始配色，確保最高金額分類使用品牌色 `#4A4A4A`。
- **Overview Page Rendering Failure**: Fixed a critical bug where the Overview page failed to render charts due to a missing `Theme` import in `js/pages/overview-page.js`.
  - 總覽頁面渲染失敗修正：補上缺少的 `Theme` 模組引入，修復圖表無法顯示的問題。
- **Toggle Switch Color**: Updated the "Split Expense" (幫朋友代墊 / 需分帳) toggle switch in the Add Page to use the brand primary color when active, replacing the previous light gray.
  - 開關顏色修正：將新增頁面的「需分帳」開關改為品牌主色，提升視覺一致性。

### Technical Details
- **Chart Color Palette**: Reverted `js/theme.js` chart colors to the original sequence: `['#4A4A4A', '#7A7A7A', '#9A9A9A', '#BDBDBD', '#D1C7BD', '#E5E5E5']`. This ensures Chart.js applies the brand color to the first (highest value) data point in sorted category data.
  - 圖表配色技術細節：Chart.js 會依序將顏色套用至資料點，因此第一個顏色（品牌色）會對應至排序後的最大值分類。
- **Import Fix**: Added `import { Theme } from '../theme.js';` to `js/pages/overview-page.js` to resolve `ReferenceError` when calling `Theme.resolveColor()`.
  - 引入修正：為 `overview-page.js` 補上 Theme 模組引入，解決 `ReferenceError` 錯誤。
- **Toggle Styling**: Modified `js/pages/add-page.js` line 85 to use `:class="form.isSplit ? 'bg-[var(--action-primary-bg)]' : 'bg-bg-subtle'"` for consistent brand color application.
  - 開關樣式：修改 `add-page.js` 第 85 行，使用 CSS 變數 `--action-primary-bg` 確保品牌色一致性。

### Files Modified
- `js/theme.js` - Restored original chart color palette
- `js/pages/overview-page.js` - Added Theme import
- `js/pages/add-page.js` - Updated toggle switch color
- `js/pages/stats-page.js` - Ensured compatibility with restored palette

## [2026-02-09T15:52:00Z] Category Management State Persistence & Dialog UX Improvement

### Bug Fixes
- **Category Save Failure**: Fixed a critical bug where newly added custom categories were not being saved to Firestore. The root cause was that navigating to the icon edit page after adding a category caused the edit mode state (`isCategoryModeEdit` and `localCategories`) to be lost, preventing the save action from executing.
  - 類別儲存失敗修正：修復新增自訂類別後無法儲存至資料庫的問題。根本原因是跳轉至圖示編輯頁面時編輯狀態遺失。
- **Icon Edit Page Save Button**: Fixed the non-functional save button on the icon edit page. The `handleSelectIcon` function now correctly updates `localCategories` in sessionStorage when in edit mode, and saves directly to the database when not in edit mode.
  - 圖示編輯頁面儲存按鈕修正：修復儲存按鈕無效的問題，現在會正確更新編輯狀態或直接儲存至資料庫。

### Features
- **State Persistence**: Implemented sessionStorage-based state persistence for category and payment method editing. The edit state is now automatically saved before navigation and restored when returning from the icon edit page.
  - 狀態持久化：實作基於 sessionStorage 的編輯狀態持久化，確保頁面跳轉後編輯狀態不會遺失。
- **Improved Unsaved Changes Dialog**: Enhanced the unsaved changes prompt to be more actionable. Changed from a passive confirmation ("您有未儲存的修改，確定要離開嗎？") to an active save prompt ("是否儲存當前編輯狀態？") with "儲存" and "不儲存" buttons.
  - 未儲存變更對話框改進：將被動確認改為主動儲存提示，按鈕文字改為「儲存」和「不儲存」，提升使用者體驗。

### Technical Details
- **State Persistence Implementation**:
  - Added `saveEditState()`, `restoreEditState()`, and `clearEditState()` methods to `settings-page.js`
  - Edit state is saved to sessionStorage before navigating to icon edit page
  - State is automatically restored in the `mounted()` lifecycle hook
  - State is cleared after successful save via `saveCategoryEdit()` or when user chooses to discard changes
  - 狀態持久化技術細節：新增三個狀態管理方法，在頁面跳轉前儲存、掛載時恢復、儲存成功後清除。

- **Icon Edit Save Logic**:
  - Modified `handleSelectIcon()` in `app.js` to check for edit mode state in sessionStorage
  - In edit mode: updates the sessionStorage state without database write
  - Not in edit mode: updates root state and calls `handleUpdateUserData()` to save to Firestore
  - 圖示編輯儲存邏輯：根據編輯模式狀態決定是更新 sessionStorage 或直接寫入資料庫。

- **Dialog Improvement**:
  - Modified `handleTabChange()` in `app.js` to use custom button text via `dialog.confirm()` options
  - Implemented event-based communication using `window.dispatchEvent()` and `CustomEvent`
  - Settings page listens for `settings-save-requested` event and triggers appropriate save method
  - Added `beforeUnmount()` lifecycle hook to clean up event listeners
  - 對話框改進技術細節：使用自訂按鈕文字，透過事件系統實現跨組件儲存觸發。

### Files Modified
- `js/pages/settings-page.js` - Added state persistence methods, event listener for save requests
- `js/app.js` - Updated `handleSelectIcon()` and `handleTabChange()` with new logic
- `js/api.js` - Added debug logging to `updateUserData()` method

### Debug Logging
Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the category save flow for easier troubleshooting:
- `[DEBUG]` prefix in `settings-page.js` for category operations
- `[DEBUG API]` prefix in `api.js` for Firestore operations
- `[DEBUG handleSelectIcon]` prefix in `app.js` for icon selection flow
- 新增完整的除錯日誌，方便追蹤類別儲存流程。

  - Project Mode toggle switch (旅行計畫模式)
  - 分帳開關、計畫模式開關

### Technical Details
- Applied `shadow-sm` class to the toggle track background element (`<div>` with `rounded-full` class) for all 5 toggle switches in the application.
- The shadow helps differentiate the toggle from the page background, especially when using the subtle gray background color (`bg-bg-subtle`).
- 為所有 5 個開關組件的背景軌道元素加入 `shadow-sm` class，與頁面背景形成視覺層次。

### [2026-02-15] Settings Page Layout Refactor & UX Polish

- **Layout Architecture Overhaul**:
    - **Section Merging**: Merged the legacy "System Config" block into the "Account Management" card to reduce vertical clutter and group related settings.
    - **Global Reordering**: Re-prioritized page hierarchy: **Travel Plans** > **Friends List** > **Interface Customization** > **Account Management**.
    - **Adaptive Context**: Account management (with login/config) now dynamically moves to the **top** in Guest mode and stays at the **bottom** for logged-in users.
- **Visual & UI Refinements**:
    - **Profile Header**: Repositioned the User Profile (Avatar/Email) to the top of the Account section. Removed the avatar border ring for a cleaner, flatter look.
    - **Subtle Sub-cards**: Applied the standardized `bg-bg-subtle` sub-card style (with icons and rounded corners) to the merged System Config inputs.
    - **Active Feedback**: Added a functional `save` icon to the System Config header that provides visual feedback (loading spinner) during automated or manual saves.
    - **Empty State Optimization**: Removed redundant "No plans/friends" text labels. The areas now adapt their height dynamically based on content, creating a tighter layout.
    - **Consistent Alignment**: Left-aligned the "User Guide" link at the bottom of the page and ensured all empty states and section headers follow a shared vertical alignment.
- **Enhanced Interactions**:
    - **Inline Management**: Added a functional "Add Friend" `+` button and inline form directly to the Friends List section, matching the Projects management experience.
    - **Cleaner Fields**: Removed "(e.g., Kyoto Trip)" examples from input placeholders to maintain a minimalist aesthetic.

*設定頁面重構與體驗優化：合併系統設定至帳號區塊並重新定義全頁排序（計畫 > 好友 > 自定義 > 帳號）。優化用戶資訊顯示位置、移除冗餘提示文字並加入即時儲存反饋圖示，同時為好友清單新增快速操作入口，打造更極簡且高效的設定介面。*

- **[Critical Fix] Project & Friend Sync Reliability**:
    - **Immediate Persistence**: Fixed a bug where newly created projects and friends would disappear after a page reload if no transaction was submitted. 
    - **Sync Strategy**: Upgraded `handleCreateProject` and `handleAddFriendToList` to perform immediate synchronization with Firebase Firestore in Admin mode, ensuring data is persisted instantly.
    - **Removed Deferred Logic**: Deprecated the "pending updates" queue in `handleSubmit` in favor of more robust, event-driven synchronization handlers.

*重大修復：解決新增計畫或好友後，若未建立交易紀錄便重新整理會導致資料消失的問題。現在改為在新增當下立即同步至 Firebase 後端，確保資料持久性。*

- **Auto-Backup & Auth Optimization**:
    - **Persistent Authorization**: Migrated Google OAuth tokens from `sessionStorage` to `localStorage`. This allows the background auto-backup to function even after browser restarts, provided the session remains active.
    - **Smart Authorization Prompt**: Implemented a proactive authorization flow. When "Daily Auto Backup" is enabled, the system checks for a valid Google token and prompts the user with a custom explanation dialog if authentication is required.
    - **Integrated UX**: The "Daily Auto Backup" toggle now acts as an entry point for Google Services setup, ensuring a seamless connection between settings and the backup destination folder.

*自動備份與授權優化：將 Google 授權權杖從 sessionStorage 遷移至 localStorage，確保瀏覽器重啟後背景備份仍能觸發。同時在開啟「每日自動備份」時新增主動授權引導對話框，確保功能開啟時已具備必要的雲端存取權限。*

- **Strict Account Matching Logic**:
    - **Identity Guard**: Implemented backend verification during the Google Drive authorization process. The system now strictly compares the email address of the Google Drive session with the app's current logged-in account.
    - **Auto-Hinting**: Added `login_hint` to the OAuth flow to pre-select and prioritize the correct email address in the Google popup, minimizing user error.
    - **Data Integrity**: Prevents the "cross-account backup" issue where data could inadvertently be saved to a different Google account logged into the same browser.

*帳號比對機制：在 Google 雲端授權過程中加入嚴格的身分比對。系統會自動引導並檢查授權帳號是否與「日日記」登入帳號一致，防止資料誤存至同瀏覽器內的其他 Google 帳戶。*

- **Project Soft Delete Capability**:
    - **Soft Deletion Mechanism**: Implemented `visible: false` logic for projects, similar to the friends list. Deleted projects are hidden from active lists but their historical data remains intact in transaction logs and stats.
    - **In-Detail Deletion UI**: Added a "Delete Project" button within the project detail's edit mode, replacing the redundant "Cancel Edit" button for a cleaner interface.
    - **Global Filtering**: Updated transaction addition, editing, and management lists to exclude projects marked as invisible, ensuring a focused and relevant workspace.

- **Unified Delete Interface**: Synchronized deletion UI across "Friends" and "Projects". Both sections now feature a low-interference "Delete" button in edit mode, replacing the "Cancel" button for a more streamlined management experience.
    - **UI Cleanup**: Removed the "Danger Zone" from the friend detail page to maintain visual consistency with other detail components.

*介面統一化：統一好友與計畫的刪除介面。兩者現在皆於編輯模式中，以簡潔的「刪除」按鈕取代「取消編輯」，並移除好友詳情頁底部的危險區域，讓整體設計語彙更趨一致。*

## [2026-02-15T17:35:00+08:00] Performance & SEO Reinforcement

### Added
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Created `robots.txt` to properly guide search engine crawlers and resolve Lighthouse SEO audit errors.
- **Resource Preconnecting**: Added `preconnect` hints for Google Fonts and Gstatic servers to reduce latency during font fetching.

### Improved
- **Loading Performance (Critical Path)**: 
    - Implemented `defer` loading for non-critical third-party libraries (`Chart.js`, `JSZip`), allowing the main UI to render faster and improving First Contentful Paint (FCP).
    - Added `&display=swap` parameter to font loading strategy (applied via `link` tags) to ensure text remains visible during font download.

### Technical Decision
- **PWA Experience Preservation**: Decided to RETAIN `user-scalable=no` in the viewport settings despite Lighthouse accessibility suggestions. This preserves the established App-like tactile interface and prevents accidental UI zooming on mobile devices, which is a core design requirement for this project.

*效能與 SEO 強化：建立 `robots.txt` 並優化資源載入策略（包含字體預連線與非關鍵腳本延遲載入），在不影響「禁止縮放」之 App 手感的前提下提升首屏渲染速度。*

    - This change significantly reduces First Contentful Paint (FCP) and eliminates the "Flash of Unstyled Content" (FOUC).

### Infrastructure
- **Build System Upgrade**: 
    - Installed `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` as dev dependencies.
    - Created `tailwind.config.js` to centralize our semantic design tokens (Shared with `design-tokens.css`).
    - Created `postcss.config.js` to automate CSS processing within the Vite pipeline.
    - Updated `style.css` to use standard `@tailwind` directives.

*Tailwind 效能優化：將樣式系統從 CDN 即時編譯遷移至建構時編譯 (PostCSS/Vite)，移除 1MB 以上的非必要腳本負載，大幅提升 App 啟動速度與渲染效能。*

---

## [2026-02-15T17:45:00+08:00] Fixed Tailwind Configuration for CommonJS Compatibility

### Fixed
- **Module Resolution Error**: Replaced ES Module `export default` with CommonJS `module.exports` in `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` to match the project's `"type": "commonjs"` environment. This fixes the layout breakage in the development environment.
- **Content Paths**: Expanded Tailwind content scanning to explicitly include `./js/pages/*.js` and `./js/components/*.js` to ensure all dynamic classes are correctly purged and compiled.

*修正編譯配置：將配置檔切換至 CommonJS 語法以相容目前專案環境，修復開發環境樣式失效（跑版）問題，並擴展 JS 組件掃描路徑以確保樣式完整編譯。*

---

## [2026-02-15T17:48:00+08:00] Fixed Tailwind CSS v4 PostCSS Integration

---

## [2026-02-15T17:55:00+08:00] Migrated to Tailwind CSS v4 Vite Plugin

### Improved
- **Compiler Architecture**: Migrated from PostCSS-based integration to the native **Tailwind CSS v4 Vite Plugin** (`@tailwindcss/vite`). This provides a more robust and faster compilation process within the Vite ecosystem.
- **Zero-Config Styling**: Deprecated separate `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` files in favor of the new CSS-first configuration using the `@theme` block in `style.css`.
- **CSS Consolidation**: Moved all remaining inline `<style>` blocks from `index.html` into the centralized `style.css` for better maintainability and performance.

### Technical Detail
- Installed `@tailwindcss/vite` and configured it in `vite.config.js`.
- Cleaned up development cache (`node_modules/.vite`) to ensure fresh compilation of all utility classes.

*架構升級：全面遷移至 Tailwind CSS v4 官方 Vite 插件，棄用舊有的 JS 配置檔，改為 CSS 優先的配置模式，並整合全站樣式至 `style.css` 以追求極致性能與乾淨代碼。*

---

## [2026-02-15T18:00:00+08:00] Fixed Font Rendering & Layout Consistency

### Fixed
- **Typography Calibration**: Explicitly defined the `sans` font stack and root `16px` font size in `style.css` to match the production site's aesthetics. Fixed the "abnormal font size" issue caused by missing font-family tokens.
- **Vite Processing Guarantee**: Migrated `style.css` from a static `<link>` tag in `index.html` to a module `import` in `js/app.js`. This ensures Vite + Tailwind v4 correctly processes the theme tokens and utility classes.
- **Config Stability**: Renamed `vite.config.js` to `vite.config.mjs` to ensure reliable ESM loading across all environments.

*核心視覺修正：明確定義 Noto Sans 字體系統與 16px 基準，並將 CSS 載入模式改為 Vite 模組化導入，徹底修復字體大小異常與開發環境編譯失效的問題。*

---

## [2026-02-15T18:05:00+08:00] Reverted to Production Baseline (Tailwind CDN)

### Decisions
- **Abandon Tailwind Build-time Compilation**: Due to significant layout shifts and typography inconsistencies in the local environment compared to production, the decision was made to revert all infrastructure changes.
- **Restore UI Integrity**: Prioritized 100% visual consistency with the live `nichi-nichi.web.app` site over performance micro-optimizations.

### Reverted Changes
- **Infrastructure**: Removed `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `vite-plugin-tailwind` from dependencies.
- **Config**: Deleted `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and reverted `vite.config.js`.
- **Scripts**: Restored Tailwind CSS CDN script and inline configuration in `index.html`.
- **Styling**: Restored original `style.css` and removed module-based CSS imports.

*全面還原：因本地編譯環境與正式版樣式存在偏差，已將所有配置還原至與 `nichi-nichi.web.app` 相同的 CDN 開發模式，確保 UI 視覺 100% 準確。*

---

---

## [2026-02-17T17:00:00+08:00] Stats Page Mobile Layout & Date Filter Fix

### Fixed
- **Mobile Horizontal Scrolling**: Replaced the side-by-side grid layout for "Custom" date inputs with a vertical stack on small screens. Added "From" and "To" labels for better UX clarity. This ensures the page width remains fixed and prevents unintended horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.
- **Single-Day Statistics**: Fixed a bug where selecting a single day (e.g., 2/17 to 2/17) resulted in zero results. Standardized transaction date comparison by slicing the timestamp to a pure `YYYY-MM-DD` format to match the date picker's output.

### Affected Files
- `js/pages/stats-page.js`

*統計頁面優化：修正選取「自訂」日期範圍時手機版會出現左右滑動的問題（改為垂直堆疊排列），並修復無法顯示單日統計資料的 Bug。*

---

## [2026-02-17T17:15:00+08:00] Page Transition Animation Consistency

### Fixed
- **History Page Entrance Animation**: Added missing `animate-in` class to the History Page (`HistoryPage`). This ensures that when switching to the history view, the page now has the same "fade-in and slide-up" effect as all other main pages (Overview, Stats, Add, Settings), providing a more cohesive and premium user experience.

### Affected Files
- `js/pages/history-page.js`

*介面一致性優化：補上明細頁面缺失的進場動畫，確保所有主要分頁在切換時都具備統一的往上升過場效果。*

---

## [2026-02-28T12:52:00+08:00] Stats Page Daily Average Calculation Logic Update

### Improved
- **Daily Average Precision**: Updated the `Daily Avg` calculation on the Stats page to be based on the number of unique days with recorded transactions, rather than total days in the month or range.
- **Selective Calculation**: This ensures that if a user starts recording mid-month, the average reflects the actual recording activity instead of being diluted by empty days at the start of the period.

### Affected Files
- `js/pages/stats-page.js`

*統計頁面優化：將「每日平均」的計算邏輯改為除以「實際有記錄的天數」，避免月初未記錄的空白天數稀釋平均值，更精確反映實際支出情形。*

---

## [2026-02-28T13:55:00+08:00] Stats Page Daily Average Calculation Logic Adjustment (Option 2)

### Improved
- **Daily Average Calculation (Option 2)**: Adjusted the calculation from using "distinct recorded days" to "recorded date range". The denominator is now calculated from the first transaction date of the period to the end of the period (or today).
- **Better UX Expectations**: This correctly handles 0-spending days within the recording period, providing a more intuitive daily average that aligns with user expectations (e.g., if a month starts from 1/20, the average is calculated across the remaining days of the month).

### Affected Files
- `js/pages/stats-page.js`

*統計頁面優化：將「每日平均」計算方式由「不重複記帳天數」調整為「記錄區間天數」（從該月第一筆起算至月底或今天），確保包含區間內的零支出日，數值更貼近穩定預算。*

---

## [2026-02-28T14:00:00+08:00] Verify Ownership & Canonical URL Update
